    "correct_answers": [
      2
    ],
    "explanation": "TLS certificate integration is essential in Kubernetes supply chain security because it encrypts and authenticates communication between components such as admission controllers and the API server. This prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with requests, thereby mitigating man-in-the-middle attacks and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.
