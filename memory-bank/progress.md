# Progress & Status: Kubernetes Security Mock Exam App

## 1. What Works (Assumed based on file structure & components)

*   **Basic Application Structure:** A React application structure exists (`src/App.js`, `src/index.js`).
*   **Component Placeholders:** Components for key features seem to be present (`HomePage`, `Exam`, `Question`, `Results`, `ProgressBar`, `Navigation`, `SideMenu`, `ReviewFlagged`). Their level of completion is unknown without code review.
*   **Data Loading Mechanism:** Code exists to load data from SQLite using `sql.js` (`src/questionsDatabase.js` likely involved).
*   **State Persistence Hook:** A `useLocalStorage` hook (`src/hooks/useLocalStorage.js`) is available for saving state.
*   **Question Data:** A SQLite database (`public/questions.sqlite`) exists, along with metadata (`src/questions_metadata.json`) and potential source files (`src/exported-questions/`).
*   **Database Management Scripts:** Tools exist (`src/admin/db-tools/`) for managing the question database.
*   **Testing Setup:** Jest configuration (`jest.config.js`, `jest.setup.js`) and some tests (`tests/questionsIntegrity.test.js`, `src/App.test.js`) are in place.
*   **Build/Dev Environment:** Configuration files (`package.json`, `craco.config.js`, `docker-compose/`) suggest standard development and build processes are set up.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Verify

*   **End-to-End Exam Flow:** Verify if a user can actually start, take, complete, and review an exam seamlessly.
*   **Component Implementation Details:** Assess the completeness and correctness of each component's logic and UI.
*   **Scoring Logic:** Confirm the accuracy of the answer checking and score calculation.
*   **State Management Integration:** Verify how `useLocalStorage` is integrated and if it correctly saves/restores all necessary exam state.
*   **Error Handling:** Check for robust error handling, especially around data loading (`sql.js`).
*   **UI/UX Polish:** Review the user interface for clarity, usability, and responsiveness.
* **Add Features:**
    *   **Source Referencing:** Add functionality to reference sources for answers (as per future plans)
*   **Test Coverage:** Evaluate the extent and effectiveness of the existing Jest tests. Add more tests as needed.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Baseline Established:** The project has a foundational structure, core components, data source, and tooling.
*   **Memory Bank Initialized:** Core documentation files have been created (as of 2025-04-18).
*   **Functionality Unverified:** The actual operational status of the application needs verification by running it or reviewing the code in detail.

## 4. Known Issues / Bugs (Initial Assessment)

*   None explicitly identified yet, but potential areas include:
    *   Performance issues related to `sql.js` loading/querying.
    *   Bugs in state management logic (e.g., race conditions, incorrect restoration).
    *   Inconsistencies in question data or scoring.
    *   UI glitches or responsiveness problems.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

*   **Initial Decision:** Use SQLite + `sql.js` for question data in order to keep it client-side and avoid server dependencies, plus it make it easier to manage.
*   **Future Decision:** Consider moving to a more dynamic data source (e.g., REST API) if the project evolves to require real-time updates or multi-user capabilities.
