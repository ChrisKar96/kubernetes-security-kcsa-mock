# Product Context: Kubernetes Security Mock Exam App

## 1. Problem Solved

Preparing for the Kubernetes Cloud Native Security Associate (KCSA) exam requires practice with realistic exam questions and formats. Currently, finding high-quality, interactive mock exams specifically tailored to the KCsa syllabus can be challenging. This application aims to bridge that gap by providing a dedicated platform for KCSA exam practice.

## 2. Product Vision

To be the go-to, user-friendly web application for KCSA candidates seeking effective practice and self-assessment before taking the official certification exam.

## 3. User Experience Goals

*   **Intuitive Interface:** The application should be easy to navigate and use, even for users less familiar with web applications.
*   **Realistic Simulation:** The exam experience should closely mimic the format and constraints of the actual KCSA exam where possible (e.g., question types, time limits if implemented later).
*   **Clear Feedback:** Users should receive clear scoring and easily understand which questions they answered correctly or incorrectly, along with explanations for the correct answers.
*   **Seamless Persistence:** Users should be able to pause and resume their exams without losing progress, thanks to local storage.
*   **Accessibility:** The application should adhere to basic web accessibility standards.

## 4. How it Should Work (High-Level)

1.  **Home Page:** Presents an overview and allows the user to start a new exam.
2.  **Exam View:**
    *   Displays one question at a time.
    *   Provides options for selecting answers (e.g., multiple choice, select all that apply).
    *   Allows navigation between questions (Next/Previous).
    *   Potentially allows flagging questions for review.
    *   Tracks progress (e.g., question X of Y).
3.  **Submission:** User submits the exam for grading.
4.  **Results Page:**
    *   Displays the overall score.
    *   Allows review of each question, showing the user's answer, the correct answer(s), and explanations.
    *   Provides source references for the correct answers (if available).
    *   Provides options to retake the exam or return to the home page.
5.  **State Management:** The application uses `useLocalStorage` hook to save the current exam state (current question index, selected answers) so the user can close the browser and resume later.
