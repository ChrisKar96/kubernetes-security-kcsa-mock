# **üõ† How to Contribute**  

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Contributing to Question Updates**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting Question Errors (Automated Process)**
To report errors in questions, answers, or explanations:

1. **Create an issue** using the "Question Error Report" template or with the following format:
   - **Title**: Include a clear description of the error (e.g., "Error on answer about Network Policies")
   - **Body**: Include the following information:
     ```
     Question ID: #42 (if known)
     
     Domain: Kubernetes_Security_Fundamentals

     Question: [The current question text]
     
     Options:
     - Option 1
     - Option 2
     - Option 3
     - Option 4
     
     Your answer: [The answer currently marked as correct]

     Correct answer: [What you believe should be correct]

     Problem: [Description of the problem]

     Suggested fix: [Your suggested fix, if any]
     
     References:
     1. [Link to supporting documentation]
     2. [Link to supporting documentation]
     
     [Optional] Needs comprehensive review: Yes
     ```
   - The system will automatically add the `question-error` label when it matches the error report pattern
   - Our automated workflow will process the issue and:
     1. Identify the specific question based on ID, text, or correct answer
     2. Use AI-assisted refinement to fix the question
     3. Update the database with the corrected information
     4. Create a pull request with the changes for review

2. **Automated processing** will:
   - Identify the relevant question (even if you don't know the exact ID)
   - Run the appropriate question revision script
   - Update the database
   - Create a pull request with the changes
   - Add a comment to your issue when complete

3. **Review the PR** that was automatically created to verify the changes

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Manual Question Update Process**
For more complex updates or when the automated process is not suitable:

1. **Open an Issue**  
Before making changes, **open an issue** in the repository to describe:  
- The **question ID** you are updating.  
- The **problem with the question** (e.g., incorrect answer, missing explanation, outdated reference).  
- The **proposed fix** or improvement.  

üí° **Example Issue:**  
```
Title: Update Question id: 42 ‚Äì Incorrect Explanation  

Description:  
The explanation for question id: 42 is incorrect.  
- **Current Explanation:** "Kubernetes API Server is responsible for managing nodes directly."  
- **Corrected Explanation:** "The Kubernetes API Server serves as the control plane, exposing RESTful APIs for interacting with the cluster."  
- **Adding Sources:** ["Kubernetes Documentation", "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/"]
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a New Branch**  
Once your issue is approved or if you're directly contributing a fix:  
```bash
git checkout -b update-question-<question_id>
```
Replace `<question_id>` with the **actual question ID**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Modify the Exported JavaScript Files**  
1. Locate the question file in **`src/exported-questions/`**  
   - Example: `src/exported-questions/Cloud_Native_Security.js`
2. Modify the question, **ensuring proper JSON formatting**.
3. **Add sources** in the correct format:  
```js
export const CloudNativeSecurityQuestions = [
  {
    "id": 7,
    "question": "What is the main function of a Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP)?",
    "options": [
      "Monitor network traffic",
      "Secure workloads across environments",
      "Manage cloud costs"
    ],
    "correct_answers": [1],
    "explanation": "CWPPs protect workloads across multiple environments.",
    "question_type": "single-choice",
    "domain": "Cloud Native Security",
    "subdomain": "Workload and Application Code Security",
    "sources": [
      {
        "name": "Kubernetes Documentation",
        "url": "https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/"
      }
    ]
  }
];
```
‚úÖ **Ensure:**
- üìù **Correct formatting** (`sources` must be an **array of objects** with `name` & `url`).  
- üî¢ **Accuracy** (Check `correct_answers`, `explanation`, and `options`).  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
Once you've made your changes, commit and push them:  
```bash
git add src/exported-questions/Cloud_Native_Security.js
git commit -m "Updated question id: 7 - Fixed explanation and added sources"
git push origin update-question-7
```
Then, **create a Pull Request (PR)**:
- **Title:** `[Update Question id: 7] Fixed explanation and added references`
- **Description:**  
  - What was changed (e.g., added sources, corrected explanation).
  - Why the change was needed.  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Review & Merge**
- Maintainers will review the PR.
- If approved, the PR will be merged, and the **SQLite database will be updated** using:
  ```bash
  node src/admin/db-tools/update_questions.mjs
  ```
- The latest questions will be **exported** back to JavaScript files using:
  ```bash
  node src/admin/db-tools/export_questions.mjs
  ```
